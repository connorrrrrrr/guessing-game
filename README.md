# Guessing-Game
Guessing game project.

This site tells a bit about myself, and prompts the user with multiple questions about me. 
1. First asks what their name is.
2. I ask the user if I am a female or not.
3. I ask do I like video games.
4. Then I ask if I'm an extrovert or not.
5. Next I ask the user if I like dogs or not.
6. Last, I ask the user if I enjoy the winter.

After these qusetions, I prompt the user to pick a number between 1-10.
